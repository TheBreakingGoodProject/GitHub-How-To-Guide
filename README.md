New to the Breaking Good Project and GitHub? You've come to the right place!

The Breaking Good Project uses GitHub as a tool to share, store and discuss information, data and ideas related to our projects. This repository is your resource on how to use GitHub in your Breaking Good project. It contains instructions on how to perform tasks in GitHub along with information on how our project repositories on GitHub are structured and organised.

In saying that, we know not everything is perfect! If you run into a problem performing a task and need some help or have a suggestion on how we can improve this repository, you can bring these to our attention by creating an issue in the issues tab above :point_up:.

Well, let's get started shall we. To use GitHub you first need to set up a GitHub account. Instructions on how to do this are on the [wiki](https://github.com/kym834/GitHub-How-To-Guide/wiki). Head on over and navigate to 'setting up a GitHub account'.
