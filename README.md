# WELCOME!

New to the Breaking Good Project and GitHub? You've come to the right place! This repository is your resource on how to use GitHub in your Breaking Good project. 

The Breaking Good Project uses GitHub as a tool to share, store and discuss information and ideas related to our projects. More information about what GitHub is and why we use it can be found in the wiki [add in link].

To use GitHub you will first need to set up a GitHub account. To get started, head on over to the [wiki](https://github.com/kym834/GitHub-How-To-Guide/wiki) and navigate to 'setting up a GitHub account'.
